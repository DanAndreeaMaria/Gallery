# Gallery slideshow #

* This is my first repository added here 100% with GIT from VS Code.

Here is a simple slideshow image gallery built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to navigate through a set of images using next/previous buttons or by clicking on thumbnails.

## Features

* Automatic hiding of images except for the active one
* Navigation buttons to move between slides
* Clickable thumbnail images for direct slide selection
* Smooth transitions for better user experience

## Technologies used

* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**

## How to use

1. Open the ```index.html``` file in a web browser
2. Click the "Next" ```(>)``` or "Previous" ```(<)``` buttons to navigate through the slides
3. Click on a thumbnail image to jump directly to the corresponding slide
